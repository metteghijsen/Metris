# Metris

## Project description
I made this project as a result of a school assignment. The assignment was to make something that can fly through your screen using keyboard inputs.
What you see in front of you here is actually an old-fashioned game of Tetris. In case you don't know how Tetris works, here's an overview of the controls:
- ↑ or W: Rotate your tetromino
- ← or A: Move your tetromino left
- ↓ or S: Move your tetromino down
- → or D: Move your tetromino right
